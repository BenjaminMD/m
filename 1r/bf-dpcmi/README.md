# BatchFitDiffPy
Small script to quickly fit a batch of PDF data containing several phases. Allows changing recipes during the fit based on conditions such as the molar contribution of a phase. Based on DiffPy and helper functions from   iucr2020_compschool.  

## Todo:
- Save individual phase contributions and total gcalc
- Create each recipe needed for the fit once and save to a Catalog of recipes to be used during the fit. To save memory and maybe run time.
